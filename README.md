  # ReadMe Generator


  ## Description

  This product generates read me .md files by asking you a series of questions over node.js. I used prompts to get the terminal to ask the user questions. They then type out their answers and their input is generated in the Read Me file.

  ## Installation

  npm i

  ## Usage

  This product can be used for generating read me files for assignments or projects. I plan on using this product in the future, I also used it on this assignment.
